# Nano-OS
An operating system that runs on Arduino using [PCPU-NANO1](https://github.com/Pepe-57/pcpu-nano1) as "core". Nano-os is successor of [Esp-cf](https://github.com/Pepe-57/esp-cf). The firmware supports only two Nano1s(no more or less, single Nano1 support will be done by someday). Current versions could be buggy!
## Requirements
- 2x Pcpu-Nano1(used for most of all calculations)
- Arduino or other microcontroller board
## Compatibily
- Tested on Arduino Uno R4 Wifi with 2x [PCPU-NANO1](https://github.com/Pepe-57/pcpu-nano1)
## Commands
